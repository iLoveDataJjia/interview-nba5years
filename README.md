🧐💯 A simple technical inverview passed for a Data Scientist position. The subject is "given the sample data [nba_logreg.csv](/interview-nba5years/resources/nba_logreg.csv) provided by an investor specialized in NBA players, are you able to make an AI accessible through REST API capable of predicting if the investment on player is worth or not ?"


# Some results

**Want to use the REST API ?**

- 🌍😋 https://nba5years.herokuapp.com/
- Nba5Years is hosted through a free billing on Heroku at the moment. It might take some seconds to charge the page.

**Some EDA on the training data**

# Want to run or modify the application yourself ?

- Install Python 3.7.11 or Use an Python virtual environnement with Python 3.7.11 (Advised)
- Clone the project to your `directory`
- From your `directory`, run `cd interview-nba5years` a first time
- Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- From `directory/interview-nba5years`, run `cd interview-nba5years` a second time
- If it's not done on your PC -> From a terminal do `set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.` (Windows) or `export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:."` (Linux)
- Then run `uvicorn restapi:app --reload`
- From a web navigator go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Happy coding! 😊😊😊


# Possible improvment

- Docstings to do for the Python codes
- Use `seed` when training the model for the reproductibily
- ...? If you reader have anything else in mind, I am happy to hear it ! 🤓
